# Online Techmeet Management System

## Abstract

The main objective of the project entitled **"Online Techmeet Management System"** is to create a website where students can register for various events. The website allows users to view event details, register for events, view winners, and enables administrators to manage events, users, and staff. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript for the front end, and PHP and MySQL for the backend.
